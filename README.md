# VRTicTac
A Virtual Reality implementation of Tic Tac Toe

### Features
- Single player game with "AI" opponent in two difficulties - Random Choice (Easy) and Minimax (Hard - cuz you really just cant win)
- "Stare to Click" Gaze Reticle for those of you out there that don't wanna use more than the plain ol' cardboard.

### Technical
- Unity/C# scene with GoogleVR SDK to implement basic VR environment
- Built my own custom reticle for "Auto Stare to Click" because no one has a good free piece of code out there (which I don't know why)
